Home Again: Together for Justice

Thousands of families in India’s marginalized religious minority communities are being violently uprooted. Their homes are demolished without legal notice. Their shops and livelihoods are boycotted. Their voices are silenced by fear, and their rights erased by rising religious extremism.

This campaign is a lifeline — to protect, empower, and restore dignity to those who are being targeted for simply existing.

We are building a movement of compassion and justice. With your help, we aim to:

What we are witnessing is not just a humanitarian crisis — it’s a moral emergency. Entire communities are being erased with bulldozers instead of justice. We cannot stay silent.

Every dollar you donate is a step toward restoring hope.
Every share amplifies the voices they’re trying to silence.
Every act of solidarity helps them reclaim the life they deserve.

Let’s bring them home again.
